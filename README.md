# Destiny 2 Zero Hour Configuration Solver
Welcome to the Github Repository for the Zero Hour Configuration Solver.  This repository will be primarily used to find and fix bugs, add features that are commonly requested, and add support for more languages.  Please see the details below for how to request features, report bugs, and submit new translations.

### Bug Report
To properly fix any bugs or style/layout issues, I'm going to request a few important pieces of information:
- Details on what went wrong VS what you expected to happen
- Which web browser (and version) you are using on which operating system (and version)
- (If a visual style/layout issue) A screenshot showing the incorrect visuals
- (If the solver gives an incorrect answer) What Console 1 and Console 3 currently read, what node the solver said to lock, and for bonus points, a video showing Console 1, Console 3, and the incorrect node.  This shouldn't happen, but I'm including this one the off-chance it does.

### Feature Request
So that I fully understand what the feature is, it would be extremely helpful to have the following information:
- Detailed description of what you think would be awesome to add
- Sketches of what you are imagining

### Translations
Not ready for this yet, please stay tuned for more information.  If you are interested in translating, please respond to this issue so that I can reach out when I have a system for translations set up.
